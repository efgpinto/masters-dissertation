\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

To all of those who somehow contributed to the success of this dissertation work.

A special thank to my supervisor Professor António Carvalho Brito who was always available to guide the work and give his feedback about the research that was being done. Also, my acknowledgement to the team within which I developed the work, namely to Professor Lia Patrício, Eng. Nelson Pinho and Eng. Miguel Oliveira who were always great advisers along the research, as well as everyone from the Ministry of Health.

To my family, specially my fathers and my sister who were always a source of support, an example of perseverance and hard work and the stimulus for a continuous search of knowledge and learning. 

To my friends with whom I have studied and worked these long five years, many thanks for all the bright nights. They were worth. It was a pleasure to ride with you.

Last but not least, to my girlfriend, who had the necessary patience to handle and support me through all the tough moments.
