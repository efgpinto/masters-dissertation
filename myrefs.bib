@article{Kazman2009,
annote = {Nos \'{u}ltimos anos verificaram-se duas tend\^{e}ncias importantes nos mercados: por um lado uma crescente utiliza\c{c}\~{a}o do conhecimento partilhado para cria\c{c}\~{a}o de servi\c{c}os e projectos de elevado valor e por outro uma crescente preponder\^{a}ncia dos servi\c{c}os.
Os neg\'{o}cios v\~{a}o evoluindo de uma perspectiva orientada ao bens para uma perspectiva orientada \`{a}s rela\c{c}\~{o}es.
Esta mudan\c{c}a de paradigma tem levado a que o cliente seja visto, progressivamente, n\~{a}o como simples receptor mas como um co-criador de valor.
Exemplo disso s\~{a}o alguns dos maiores sistemas baseados em comunidades como a Wikipedia e  Facebook capazes de gerar valor a partir dos seus utilizadores.
        
O Metropolis Model surge como uma tentativa de descrever sistemas ultra-mega complexos constru\'{\i}dos essencialmente a partir de dois conceitos: OpenSource Software (OSS) e Community-Based Service Systems (CBSS).
        
Apesar da crescente import\^{a}ncia do OSS continuar\~{a}o a existir sempre sistemas para os quais n\~{a}o faz sentido aplicar um sistema de desenvolvimento feito por massas, seja por serem demasiado cr\'{\i}ticos para uma empresa ou por exigirem garantias de seguran\c{c}a e fiabilidade inquestion\'{a}veis.
        
Algumas caracter\'{\i}sticas que \'{e} poss\'{\i}vel identificar dos chamados crowdsourced systems: 
        
- equipas abertas: o conceito de uma equipa dedicada de programadores deve ser abandonada;
        
- capacidade de integra\c{c}\~{a}o: muitos dos grandes projectos existentes nascem hoje do reaproveitamento e capacidade de integra\c{c}\~{a}o com outros projectos, muito a exemplo do que que foi feito com o GNU + Linux, por exemplo. O software cria-se cada vez mais tirando partido das funcionalidades oferecidas por outros softwares;
        
- conflitos e requisitos imprevis\'{\i}veis: neste tipo de sistemas os requisitos emergem dos pr\'{o}prios contribuidores, dos pr\'{o}prios utilizadores e n\~{a}o s\~{a}o poss\'{\i}veis de serem previstos. Dessa forma, \'{e} f\'{a}cil compreender que requisitos provinientes de diferentes utilizadores entram muitas vezes em conflito;
        
- evolu\c{c}\~{a}o cont\'{\i}nua:  como consequ\^{e}ncia da mudan\c{c}a constante de requisitos e de possuir recursos distribu\'{\i}dos, um sistema deste tipo nunca est\'{a} acabado nem est\'{a}vel: "perpetual beta". O desenvolvimento do projecto faz-se atrav\'{e}s de m\'{u}ltiplas itera\c{c}\~{o}es delegando na comunidade de utilizadores a responsabilidade de assegurar e testar a qualidade do mesmo;
        
- operacionais: a disponibilidade das opera\c{c}\~{o}es e servi\c{c}os que oferecem s\~{a}o t\~{a}o importantes com a sua utilidade e nesse sentido n\~{a}o \'{e} aceite qualquer tipo de indisponibilidade por parte do sistema;
        
- fiabilidade aceit\'{a}vel: a no\c{c}\~{a}o de "perpetual beta" introduz a ideia de aceita\c{c}\~{a}o de software incompleto. A exemplo da Wikipedia que nunca reclamou ser completa ou mesmo estar completamente correcta;
        
- recursos inst\'{a}veis: neste tipo de projectos as pessoas, a informa\c{c}\~{a}o e outro tipo de recursos s\~{a}o extramente vol\'{a}teis. A utiliza\c{c}\~{a}o de recursos (que isoladamente seriam despropositados e in\'{u}teis) em massa permite criar uma sistema fi\'{a}vel e por vezes computacionalmente muito robusto;
        
- comportamentos emergentes: neste tipo de sistema emergem com frequ\^{e}ncia comportamentos e tend\^{e}ncias completamente inesperados. Ao contr\'{a}rio dos sistemas tradicionais em que o determinismo comportamental \'{e} um objectivo, neste tipo de sistemas Metropolis as massas tomam o leme rapidamente;
        
O Metropolis Model apresenta uma nova vis\~{a}o unificada entre os dois maiores tipos de crowdsourced systems: CBSS e OSS, focando-se deliberadamente na cria\c{c}\~{a}o de valor pelas massas.
        
Este modelo sugere a cria\c{c}\~{a}o de dois n\'{\i}veis: kernel services e  periphery services. O kernel da aplica\c{c}\~{a}o pode ser desenvolvido atrav\'{e}s de modelos mais tradicionais, tipicamente evolutivos.
        
As implica\c{c}\~{o}es do Metropolis Model listam-se em seguida:
- focus na gest\~{a}o das massas: as massas s\~{a}o boas para determinado tipo de fun\c{c}\~{o}es, n\~{a}o para todas
- separa\c{c}\~{a}o do kernel da periferia:
- altera\c{c}\~{a}o do processo de requisitos:
- import\^{a}ncia da arquitectura: sendo a arquitectura do kernel um dos maiores factores de consist\^{e}ncia do sistema, este n\~{a}o pode emergir, tem que ser pensado e criado para promover a facilidade de integra\c{c}\~{a}o das diversas partes e pautar-se pela qualidade;
- planos para testes distribu\'{\i}dos: o kernel deve ser testado intensamente e constantemente;
- criar mecanismos de delivery autom\'{a}ticos: \'{e} importante a exist\^{e}ncia de um sistema que permita a coexist\^{e}ncia de m\'{u}ltiplas vers\~{o}es e vers\~{o}es antigas e ser\'{a} at\'{e} aconselh\'{a}vel alguma toler\^{a}ncia para conflitos com outros sistemas;
- planos para disponibilidade m\'{a}xima: o sistema dever\'{a}, de forma expl\'{\i}cita, monitorizar o seu pr\'{o}prio estado e criar mecanismos de controlo que permitam que os erros perif\'{e}ricos n\~{a}o afectem o n\'{u}cleo do sistema.

Patient and consumer principles guiding the development of the PHR reflect issues of access, control, privacy, and security. Working models illustrate the variations of RHIOs and PHRs possible and suggest the benefits that electronic information exchange can accrue for healthcare and healthcare consumers. Today both the private and public sectors are working to define the issues involved in efforts that are now taking place and that will transform healthcare.

Using basic patterns of health network data flow and trust models to support secure communication between network nodes, we abstract network security requirements to a core set to enable secure inter-network data sharing. We propose a minimum set of security controls that can be implemented without needing major new technologies, but yet realize network security and privacy goals of confidentiality, integrity and availability. This framework combines a set of technology mechanisms with environmental controls, and is shown to be sufficient to counter commonly encountered network security threats adequately.},

abstract = {Realising the vision of pervasive healthcare will generate new challenges to system security. Such challenges are fundamentally different from issues and problems that we face in centralised approaches as well as non-clinical scenarios. In this paper, we reflect upon our experiences in the HealthAgents project wherein a prototype system was developed and a novel approach employed that supports data transfer and decision making in human brain tumour diagnosis and treatment. While the decision making needs to rely on different clinical expertise, the HealthAgents system leveraged a domain ontology to align different sub-domain vocabularies and we have experimented with a process calculus to glue together distributed services. We examine the capability of the Lightweight Coordination Calculus (LCC), a process calculus based language, in meeting security challenges in pervasive settings, especially in the healthcare domain. The key difference in approach lies in making the representational abstraction reflect the relative autonomy of the various clinical specialisms involved in contributing to patient management. The scope within LCC of accommodating Boolean-valued constraints allows for flexible integration of heterogeneous sources in multiple formats, which are characteristic features of a pervasive healthcare environment.},

@article{Coiera2011,
abstract = {Electronic referrals and discharge summaries can improve the quality and timeliness of clinical communication. The electronic summary care record (SCR) extends the concept of digital health summaries to create a perpetually updated and centrally stored summary of care, extracting key data from local systems after each encounter. The only major SCR evaluation to date, in England, found that rates of usage were low, and any impact on care was difficult to quantify. The SCR is seen by some as a first step to building a national distributed shared electronic health record (SEHR). However, the SCR may be a problematic diversion, creating a need for centralised databases, while the SEHR can function by sharing locally stored records, letters and discharge summaries. Uncertainty about the quality and provenance of SCR data raises concerns about patient safety, as key data may be absent and old data may persist, partly because of a lack of ownership of the summary. A national e-health strategy should emphasise the true stepping stones to a distributed and shared electronic record, including encouraging the uptake and meaningful use of electronic clinical records, clinical messaging, electronic discharge summaries and letters, and services such as decision support and e-prescribing, all of which have good evidence to support them.},

abstract = {Recently there has been a remarkable upsurge in activity surrounding the adoption of personal health record (PHR) systems for patients and consumers. The biomedical literature does not yet adequately describe the potential capabilities and utility of PHR systems. In addition, the lack of a proven business case for widespread deployment hinders PHR adoption. In a 2005 working symposium, the American Medical Informatics Association’s College of Medical Informatics discussed the issues surrounding personal health record systems and developed recommendations for PHR-promoting activities. Personal health record systems are more than just static repositories for patient data; they combine data, knowledge, and software tools, which help patients to become active participants in their own care. When PHRs are integrated with electronic health record systems, they provide greater benefits than would stand-alone systems for consumers. This paper summarizes the College Symposium discussions on PHR systems and provides definitions, system characteristics, technical architectures, benefits, barriers to adoption, and strategies for increasing adoption.},

abstract = {In 1984, Peter Reichertz gave a lecture on the past, present and future of hospital information systems. In the meantime, there has been a tremendous progress in medicine as well as in informatics. One important benefit of this progress is that our life expectancy is nowadays significantly higher than it would have been even some few decades ago. This progress, leading to aging societies, is of influence to the organization of health care and to the future development of its information systems. Twenty years later, referring to Peter Reichertz' lecture, but now considering health information systems (HIS), two questions are discussed: which were lines of development in health information systems from the past until today? What are consequences for health information systems in the future? The following lines of development for HIS were considered as important: (1) the shift from paper-based to computer-based processing and storage, as well as the increase of data in health care settings; (2) the shift from institution-centered departmental and, later, hospital information systems towards regional and global HIS; (3) the inclusion of patients and health consumers as HIS users, besides health care professionals and administrators; (4) the use of HIS data not only for patient care and administrative purposes, but also for health care planning as well as clinical and epidemiological research; (5) the shift from focusing mainly on technical HIS problems to those of change management as well as of strategic information management; (6) the shift from mainly alpha-numeric data in HIS to images and now also to data on the molecular level; (7) the steady increase of new technologies to be included, now starting to include ubiquitous computing environments and sensor-based technologies for health monitoring. As consequences for HIS in the future, first the need for institutional and (inter-) national HIS-strategies is seen, second the need to explore new (transinstitutional) HIS architectural styles, third the need for education in health informatics and/or biomedical informatics, including appropriate knowledge and skills on HIS. As these new HIS are urgently needed for reorganizing health care in an aging society, as last consequence the need for research around HIS is seen. Research should include the development and investigation of appropriate transinstitutional information system architectures, of adequate methods for strategic information management, of methods for modeling and evaluating HIS, the development and investigation of comprehensive electronic patient records, providing appropriate access for health care professionals as well as for patients, in the broad sense as described here, e.g. including home care and health monitoring facilities. Comparing the world in 1984 and in 2004, we have to recognize that we imperceptibly, stepwise arrived at a new world. HIS have become one of the most challenging and promising fields of research, education and practice for medical informatics, with significant benefits to medicine and health care in general.},

Information about patients' medications, adverse drug reactions and allergies is transferred twice every day from GP systems to the ECS. Access is then available to authorised health-care professionals at the national help line, at out-of-hours services and in accident and emergency departments. An economic analysis of the ECS implementation showed that annual benefits exceeded annual costs after about seven years. Approximately 77\% of the benefits were non-financial and 23\% from redeployed finance. No cash savings were planned and none were realised. As ECS utilisation increased from 2006, the net benefits became positive. This relationship between utilisation and net benefits is a common feature of successful e-health investment.},

The technical and business implications of an architecture need to be fully understood. And, in cases of legacy systems, the architecture of an existing system may need to be reverse engineered.},

However, at the end of 10 years, steady state annual net value ranging from\$13 billion to -\$29 billion. Interoperable PHRs provide the most value, followed by third-party PHRs and payer-tethered PHRs also showing positive net value. Provider-tethered PHRs constantly demonstrating negative net value.},

The meso view addresses the people, organization, network and implementation dimensions. The macro view focuses on the contextual dimensions of technology standard, funding/incentive, legislation/policy and professional practice. Validation of this extended BE framework is being planned through a comparative review of recent HIS evaluation literature, a Delphi-consensus process with HIS experts and users, and multiple validation studies with recent HIS implementation projects in British Columbia.},

abstract = {Twenty years ago, a new field was born that soon came to be known as enterprise architecture. This paper covers a broad introduction to the field of enterprise architecture. Although the history of the field goes back 20 years, the field is still evolvingand rapidly so.},
annote = {A arquitectura empresarial apareceu pela primeira vez h\'{a} cerca de 20 anos atr\'{a}s e debru\c{c}ava-se essencialmente por dois problemas: complexidade dos sistemas e fraca orienta\c{c}\~{a}o ao neg\'{o}cio.
        
Mais custo, menos valor. Nos \'{u}ltimos 20 anos, o problema tem crescido, impulsionado com o crescimento da complexidade dos sistemas e com a diminui\c{c}\~{a}o do valor que poder\'{a} trazer.
        
Muitos modelos de arquitecturas empresariais foram aparecendo e desaparecendo. Hoje em dia, por volta de 90\% do mercado \'{e} dominado por estas 4:
- The Zachman Framework
- The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)
- The Federal Enterprise Architecture
- The Gartner Methodology
        
Nenhuma destas propostas \'{e} perfeita, todos possuem vantagens e fraquezas e devem sempre ser adaptadas ao objectivo em quest\~{a}o.
====== 
A Zachman Framework permite-nos garantir que todas as perspectivas de todos os stakeholders est\~{a}o a ser tidas em conta. Permite-nos agrupar os artefactos de forma a perceber se: os artefactos s\~{a}o suficientemente focados; existem artefactos que permitam esclarecer todos os players; desde o business owner at\'{e} ao database designer os objectivos se mant\^{e}m alinhados. 
======
        
A TOGAF pode ser descrita como um processo para a constru\c{c}\~{a}o de uma arquitectura empresarial, e divide a EA em 4 categorias: Business Architecture, Application Architecture, Data Architecture e Technical Architecture.
A parte mais importante desta framework \'{e}, exactamente por isso, o Architecture Development Method (ADM).
Para al\'{e}m disso, a TOGAF segue uma aproxima\c{c}\~{a}o da generalidade para a especifica\c{c}\~{a}o, construindo a arquitectura a partir de modelos gen\'{e}ricos at\'{e} chegar \`{a} arquitectura da organiza\c{c}\~{a}o. Neste sentido, s\~{a}o identificadas algumas camadas de abstra\c{c}\~{a}o: Enterprise Continuum, Foundation Architectures, Common System Architectures, Industry Architectures e Organizational Architectures.
No que diz respeito ao ADM, divide-se em oito fases (de A a E), sendo que cada uma delas exige uma proxidade \`{a} \'{a}rea do neg\'{o}cio ou da tecnologia no sentido de ir alinhando as duas vis\~{o}es.
A TOGAF recomenda a flexibiliza\c{c}\~{a}o dos passos que refere de forma a que se adaptem \`{a} empresa em quest\~{a}o.
        
======
        
A Federal Enterprise Architecture agrega conceitos abordados nas duas Frameworks anteriores. Por um lado, permite uma classifica\c{c}\~{a}o taxon\'{o}mica dos artefactos e define ainda um processo de arquitectura.
Antes de abordar as diferentes recomenda\c{c}\~{o}es da FEA importa referir alguns conceitos fundamentais: 
- segmentos: segmentos de miss\~{a}o central (ex: educa\c{c}\~{a}o para o Min. Educa\c{c}\~{a}o) e segmentos de servi\c{c}os de neg\'{o}cio (ex: gest\~{a}o financeira)
- servi\c{c}os empresariais (ex: gest\~{a}o de seguran\c{c}a)
        
        Modelos de refer\^{e}ncia do FEA        
- modelo de refer\^{e}ncia de neg\'{o}cio
- modelo de refer\^{e}ncia de componentes
- modelo t\'{e}cnico de refer\^{e}ncia
- modelo de refer\^{e}ncia de dados- modelo de refer\^{e}ncia de performance
                  
Processo do FEA        
1) an\'{a}lise arquitectural
2) defini\c{c}\~{a}o da arquitectura
3) estrat\'{e}gia de financiamento e investimento
4) gest\~{a}o do planeamento e execu\c{c}\~{a}o do projecto
                  
Medi\c{c}\~{a}o do sucesso
        Avalia\c{c}\~{a}o dos diferentes departamentos em graus de maturidade, no que diz respeito a: complitude da arquitectura; uso da arquitectura e resultados e benif\'{\i}cios da mesma. Classificam-se ainda os diferentes departamentos em tr\^{e}s niveis: verde, amarelo e vermelho.

"Architecture is a verb, not a noun." Christ J. Kamages        
        
Gartner n\~{a}o pode ser descrito nem como um processo taxon\'{o}mico, nem como um processo, muito menos como uma metodologia completa. Em vez disso, pode definir-se como uma pr\'{a}tica. \'{E} uma pr\'{a}ctica para arquitecturas empresariais realizada por uma empresa de consultadoria, a Gartner.
        
Esta pr\'{a}tica n\~{a}o se baseia no que a empresa \'{e}, mas naquilo que quer ser, nos objectivos que pretende atingir. Acredita-se que o fundamental est\'{a} em formar uma equipa constituida por pessoas do neg\'{o}cio, especialistas em informa\c{c}\~{a}o e os respons\'{a}veis de implementa\c{c}\~{a}o. O essencial para por criar neste grupo de pessoas uma vis\~{a}o comum para a empresa.

Similarly researchers at Kaiser Permanente in Colorado discovered that 58 percent of hypertension patients using mPHRs lowered their blookd pressure to healthy levels within six months, compared to 38 persent receiving conventional treatment.},

Na arquitectura de um edif\'{\i}cio, o arquitecto come\c{c}a por tentar perceber os requisitos gerais, como por exemplo o n\'{u}mero de divis\~{o}es da casa e o seu prop\'{o}sito geral.  Para este fase s\~{a}o utilizados bubble charts.

Finalmente, o arquitecto apresenta os seus planos que devem reflectir as percep\c{c}\~{o}es e requisitos do cliente. Estes planos incluem v\'{a}rios detalhes sobre como deve ser feita a contru\c{c}\~{a}o em termos de materiais, instala\c{c}\~{o}es el\'{e}ctricas, etc.

No fundo, pode dizer-se que existem tr\^{e}s intervenientes fundamentais neste processo de constru\c{c}\~{a}o de projectos complecos de engenharia, o cliente, o arquitecto e o construtor.

A prerequisite for real integration and semantic interoperability is agreement of the data content and the information models. The National Board of Health is working on a common model for EHR, and its adoption is now being promoted through pilot projects. At the same time, several development and implementation projects are taking place at a regional level. These EHRs are built on information models from different vendors and are based on different integration platforms. The Danish EHR observatory, which has been monitoring the development of EHRs in Denmark since 1998, has analysed the challenges of using different information models and integration platforms. This paper also maps the development in Denmark to the new paradigms in modelling techniques and integration technology.},

abstract = {In this study, we suggest an enterprise architecture (EA) development process model suitable for EA projects limited in scope and time. Several EA process models have been put forward, which have in common the idea of comprehensive EA management and development that is generic, cyclic and ongoing in a user organization. The suggested models are of varying level of abstraction. It is not simple to select the right issues from them for a restricted development effort. An ICT services provider needs a process model to follow in EA consulting and development projects. This approach is also needed for incremental EA development by user organizations. Starting with the suggested EA process models and with findings in IS literature, we create a generic process model for EA management. Based on this model, and supported with a case study, we then develop a process model for discrete EA development efforts undertaken as incremental steps.},

abstract = {Early in 2004, the British Government announced the award of eight enormous IT contracts with a combined value of more than d6 billion. The companies selected would introduce new IT systems and processes to Europe’s largest public sector organisation, the National Health Service (NHS) in England. The contracts were due to run for 7 years, until December 2010. At the end of June this year, the contracts will be exactly halfway through. But all is not well with the National Programme for IT (NPfIT), and both the programme and the agency NHS Connecting for Health (NHS CfH) set up to deliver the programme, have received considerable, and sustained criticism from many sources since their inception. Is this criticism justified or are some critics simply jumping onto a bandwagon? This paper attempts to provide an unbiased (if such a thing is possible) commentary on the programme so far.},

Business process required composition of services and execution of services as per the event. Events are responsible to change the state of process so we can model the business process based event and state. Web services (WS) is emerging technology to publish, discover and invoke the software component as services. SOA is a conceptual architecture for building integrated, loosely coupled, interoperable distributed heterogeneous enterprise application by using services as building blocks. Existing service-oriented computing standards and technologies are not fully event-driven business process where supporting event-driven composition, security, state and transaction management is highly recommended. Because of the limitation of current standards do not support event-driven modeling and implementation of event-driven process. We proposed Event-driven SOA (EDSOA) as an extension of SOA to model the event-driven process chains and to achieve event-driven automation of business process. In this paper we have given Event-driven SOA lifecycle and also demonstrate its implementation of scenario. realization with the of prototype real-life},

Despite widespread interest, there has been little discussion around PHR governance at an organizational level. We develop a governance model and compare it to the practices of some of the early PHR adopters, including hospitals and ambulatory care settings, insurers and health plans, government departments, and commercial sectors. Decision-making structures varied between organizations. Business operations were present in all groups, but patients were not represented in any of the governance structures surveyed. To improve patient-centered care, policy making for PHRs needs to include patient representation at a governance level.},
