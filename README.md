## Abstract
The Information Technologies have revolutionized many areas of society. Since many years ago, the health area has been searching for solutions to improve existing processes, having as the main objective the improvement of healthcare services. In this sense, the availability of patient clinical data can be vital to a more effective diagnosis and treatment, by a health professional. This infor- mation should be accessible regardless of context, place, time or where it was collected. In order to share this type of data, many countries have initiated projects implementing Electronic Health Record (EHR), including Portugal in 2010.

The EHR complexity and scope makes it a high cost and risk project. In fact, the inherent dif- ficulties of a project like this are as critical as its importance and the impact it has on societies. The implementation of a successful EHR implies, in most cases, the involvement of all stakeholders, from patient to health organizations, along with the professionals themselves, becoming a very long and continuous process.

In the context of this dissertation we propose an architecture for implementing the Portuguese EHR. The proposed architecture should serve as a platform for sharing information between mul- tiple health entities, normalizing processes, applying conventions and chasing interoperability among agents. The ability of the system evolution on one hand, and ease of integration in in- ternational projects on the other, were two major concerns to be taken into account throughout the proposal definition process.

This dissertation project was developed in straight collaboration with the Ministry of Health. The architectural proposal results basically from the application of some ideas of Metropolis Model and Service-oriented Architectures. This proposal advocates the delimitation of the plat- form scope with the goal of promoting the creation of value by the stakeholders through well- defined and standardised data services.

Despite of the pressure to obtain quick results, the research work concludes that it is possible to do some strategic adjustments and, with that, be able to accomplish quick wins without precluding the future met of requirements. However, the creation of an EHR is a continuous and long process that will extend for several years.
